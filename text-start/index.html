        They were all <em>wearing green jumpsuits and silly hats</em>, and 
        seemed to be having a whale of a time.

    <h3>Quick hummus recipe</h3>
    <p>&ensp;This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted 
      from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
    <p>&ensp;Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle 
      Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
      <li>175g of tahini</li>
      <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
      <li>Half a red pepper</li>
      <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
      <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>&ensp;For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of 
      lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p>&ensp;Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. 
      You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>
    <p>&ensp;Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it 
      and use it within a couple of months.</p>

      Meanxwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and pondering when the next spin off series would come out, 
      when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
